1.R if else
```{r}
x <- 10
x1 <- 20
x2 <- 30
```
1. Signs
Equals (==)
Not equal to (!=)
Greater (>)
Less than (<)
Greater than or equal to(>=)
less than or equal to (<=)

2. Operators
AND (&)
OR (|)

3. R if 
an if statement is used to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is true
{}are used to define the scope
```{r}
a <- 20
b <- 220
if(b>a){print("b is greater than a")}
```
```{r}

```

4. else if
It tells R if the first condition is not met ,try the other condition
```{r}
a <- 30
b <- 30

if ()
```

5. if else......captures that which is not captured above
```{r}
a <- 30
b <- 220

if (b>a){
  print ("b is less than a")
} else print ("b is greater than a")
```

AND and OR operators
They are logical operators and are used to combine conditional statements
```{r}
A <- 30
B <- 220
c <- 400
if(b>a&c>a){print("if both conditions are TRUE")}
`












7. while loop -excecutes a statement
